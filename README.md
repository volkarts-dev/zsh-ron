# zsh-ron

## About

My personal zsh configuration. It makes use of
[autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions),
[syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) and
[powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) as theme engine.
It is implemented as a standalone zsh script to be included in the `.zshrc`-file.

This plugin uses some code snippets from the following projects

- [oh my zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
- [Zap](https://github.com/zap-zsh/zap)
