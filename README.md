# zsh-ron

## About

My personal zsh configuration. It utilizes [Zap](https://github.com/zap-zsh/zap), [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
and some other zsh plugins. It is implemented as a plugin for zsh and an install script to create the necessary `.zshrc`-file.

This plugin uses some code snippets from the following projects

- [oh my zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
- [Zap](https://github.com/zap-zsh/zap)

## Install

To install Zap and the required dependencies along with this plugin run:

```zsh
zsh <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/volkarts-dev/zsh-ron/main/install.zsh)
```
